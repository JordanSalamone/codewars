This is a collection of all Codewars I have completed. Codewars is a platform that helps you learn, train, and improve your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels.

## How It's Done:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

The first thing I do every morning is solve a Codewar!

Because of this, I have greatly expedited gaining knowledge in problem solving. Taking on increasingly difficult challenges, I have boldly strengthened my skills with JavaScript. And after solving a task, I compare my answer with other users and learn from them or help less experienced users by answering their questions.


## Lessons Learned:

Learning new ways to solve problems on a platform like Codewars is so much fun! Optimizing my code to be more readable and more efficient is also Who doesn't enjoy a new challenge everyday?!
